### Comments on the grading
- If there are NOs in this FEEDBACK document, address it according to the description
- User must choose how many number of sticks. 
- There is too much redundancy in this code. 
- There is inappropriate comment at the beginning of your code. I don't know if this is your way of insulting me or this is a mistake, but I would like to discuss it by the end of class on Monday.
